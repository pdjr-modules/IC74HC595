# class `IC74HC595` 

ADT representing an IC74H595-based parallel output buffer.

The [IC74HC595](#classIC74HC595) IC is an 8-channel serial-in-parallel-out (SIPO) buffer. Multiple IC74H595's can be daisy-chained to increase the number of available output channels in increments of eight.

In this abstraction the state of all buffer output channels is represented by an integer 'status' value which on architectures with 32-bit integers limits the maximum number of daisy-chained buffers that can be operated to four.

## Members

#### `public  `[`IC74HC595`](#classIC74HC595_1a708326f72afe13f1d4c53c078aa9890b)`(unsigned char gpioClock,unsigned char gpioData,unsigned char gpioLatch,unsigned int buffer)` 

Construct a new buffer object.

#### Parameters
* `gpioClock` - GPIO pin connected to the IC74H595 clock pin. 

* `gpioData` - GPIO pin connected to the IC74H595 data pin. 

* `gpioLatch` - GPIO pin connected to the IC74H595 data pin. 

* `buffer` - number of [IC74HC595](#classIC74HC595) ICs in the buffer daisy-chaine (optional: defaults to 1).

#### `public void `[`begin`](#classIC74HC595_1a66416a0c85080cd00c3ebede9fca3f7b)`()` 

Initiliase the buffer.

This method must be called from setup() before any attempt is made to write data to the buffer. It sets the GPIO pin modes and sets all buffer outputs OFF.

#### `public void `[`write`](#classIC74HC595_1a1ab013254c6c18ef3ab6f5fdce9d62e9)`(unsigned int status)` 

Set the buffer outputs to a specified state.

Each bit in *status* defines the output state of a single parallel output channel: bits 0 through 7 define the states of channels 0 through 7 on the first buffer IC in any daisy chain; bits 8 through 15 the states of channels 0 throgh 7 on any second buffer IC and so on.

#### Parameters
* `status` - the value to be written to the buffer.

#### `public void `[`writeBit`](#classIC74HC595_1ac45af8c0593cb443fc0025b4647da2e8)`(unsigned int state,unsigned int bit)` 

Set the state of a single buffer output.

When it is not appropriate to set the state of all buffer outputs in a single operation, this method can be used to set a single parallel output channel by specifying the output channel number (in the range 0 through 31) and the value to which it should be set.

#### Parameters
* `state` - the value to be assigned (0 or 1). 

* `bit` - index of the output channel to be set (defaults to 1).

#### `public void `[`configureCallback`](#classIC74HC595_1ae79db8eb5438aba43f9c9317bda1a607)`(unsigned int(*)(unsigned int buffer) callback,unsigned long updateInterval)` 

Configure a callback function.

The callback function will be invoked every *updateInterval* milliseconds and passed the current buffer status as its only argument. The callback must return a new status value which will be promptly written to the buffer.

#### Parameters
* `callback` - a callback function. 

* `updateInterval` - interval between invocations of *callback* in milliseconds (optional: defaults to 1s).

#### `public void `[`callbackMaybe`](#classIC74HC595_1a9b94635c84aedde3e0df7452a0139763)`(bool force)` 

Invoke any configured callback.

This method should typically be called from loop() with no *force* to trigger an invocation of any configured callback function at the configured update interval. The method can be call with *force* set to true to invoke an immediate callback.

#### Parameters
* `force` - if true, forces an immediate invocation of any configured callback (optional: default to false).
